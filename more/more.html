                    <p>
                        My name is Muhammad Muflih Abdurrafi. I was born in Harapan Bunda Hospital, East Jakarta, Indonesia at Monday, 20th of May 2002. I am the fourth and last child of my parents. Throughout my childhood I went back and
                        forth to Saudi Arabia because of my father's work.
                    </p>

                    <p>I spent approximately six years in Saudi Arabia. Whilst living in there, I went to international schools since the first grade (year one) where I was able to learn and use English on the daily.</p>

                    <p>
                        The other half of my childhood was spent in my home country, Indonesia. The first time going back to school in Indonesia was quite nerve-racking because I didn't understand how anything works in Indonesia. Thankfully
                        I've always been able to speak my mother tongue, so the adaptation process was not as hard as it would be if I weren't able to.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="rightSide">
                    <p>
                        At the end, I also spent six years in Indonesia. Two years of elementary school, one year of middle school, and three years of high school. I just realized that I approximately spent the same amount of time in Saudi
                        and Indonesia during my school years, but the later years are the ones that really had more impact in my personal development.
                    </p>

                    <p>After that I still continued my education in Indonesia. Currently studying Informatics in Jenderal Soedirman University.</p>

                    <p class="fade">I'd say that I have a lot of hobbies. Here are the list of my hobbies:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="fade">Competitive Video Games</li>

                    <p class="fade">
                        To be honest, these are mostly the things that I like. I don't really do every single one of them, but if I had the chance I'd love to. Some are also my older hobbies that I left behind, such as playing competitive
                        video games (CSGO & Valorant).
                    </p>
                    <p class="fade">
                        Even though I was a pretty good player (GE CSGO & Immo Valorant), I came to a realization that I don't plan on getting to the highest level, so I stopped playing and started working on money making skills such as
                        programming and communication.
