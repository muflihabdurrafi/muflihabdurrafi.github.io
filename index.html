            <p>"Your efforts will never betray your own results." That is one of the principles that I always hold tight. I believe, everything we do with seriousness will produce very good and satisfying results when we get to the end of it. Even if the results do not match the expectations, we can still appreciate ourselves for all the hard work that we had done. Therefore, I will always strive with sincerity to achieve my goals.<br><br>

                My name is Muhammad Muflih Abdurrafi, the 4th child out of 4 siblings. I used to go to an international school in Saudi Arabia with a total of 6 years of education (not consecutive). As a result, my English is practically trained, both verbally and in writing. I moved and resettled in Indonesia since high school grade X in 2017 and I graduated in 2020 from SMAN 2 Gunung Putri.<br><br>
                
                During high school, I majored in science because I liked mathematics. At the beginning of high school, it was very difficult for me to adapt because I didn't have a single relationship at SMAN 2 Gunung Putri. Even so, I managed to socialize and make friends with many colleagues at school. I was known as a friendly and ambitious student, especially when grade XII kicked in. I rarely break the rules because I think success can flourish from being disciplined.<br><br>
                
                Since I was a teenager, I already have a computer for myself. However, I wasn't that interested in programming at that point. As time went on, I began to develop an interest in the world of technology and computer science because of the high potential in the future. I tried several times to code something. Some of the examples are: creating a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript; configuring a server for games; and learning Python. I am currently trying to master a wider range of programming skills and languages.<br><br>
                
                Thus, I have a dream to become a programming expert in applications, websites, games, and other software related projects. Even though I don't know much about programming yet, I will try my best to achieve it.<br><br>
